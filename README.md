## Executive Summary

Traditional intelligence systems rely on predefined workflows or reactive learning loops. **Autocatalytic Intelligence** reimagines this by treating the agent’s own creations—algorithms, heuristics, models—as catalysts for further innovation. Building on **ToolDepth** \[1] (a metric for measuring recursive tool-making) and **Reverse ToolDepth** \[2] (designing systems to maximize that metric), this framework positions intelligence as an **autocatalytic cycle**: each tool generated accelerates the production of the next.

Key highlights:

* **Self-Catalysis**: Tools become active ingredients in the creation of new tools, forging a virtuous growth loop.
* **Dynamic Generativity**: Agents evaluate and refine their internal toolbox based on recursive depth and utility.
* **Architectural Blueprint**: Specifies modules for generation, evaluation, memory, and control that drive continuous self-expansion.

This approach shifts AI from static optimization to **emergent, self-propagating intelligence**—a step toward systems that design their own evolution.
